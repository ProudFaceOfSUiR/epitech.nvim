# EPITECH.nvim

A very simple neovim plugin for generating headers, according to the template
```
/*
** EPITECH PROJECT, $YEAR
** $NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT
** File description:
** No file there, just an epitech header example.
** You can even have multiple lines if you want! 
*/
```

### TODO:
- add automatic year generation
- add ability to create Makefile headers
- may be something else, not sure
